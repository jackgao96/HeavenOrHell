# HeavenOrHell
A challenging dodge shooting game.

## Inspiration
We like game and we want to make different types of games.
## What it does
Using arrow keys to dodge the barrage. Try to live as long as possible.
## How we built it
We use the Unity to make this game and C# to write the scripts.
## Challenges we ran into
The most difficult part is the script for the attacking. We need to design different attacking styles with different algorithms.
